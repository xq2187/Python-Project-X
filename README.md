## Predicting the Airbnb House Price

Our project is to make a reasonable and sensitive prediction for Airbnb houses price. In general, there are many features of a property that may affect its price. We are interested in how these features affect the price of the Airbnb property. The original dataset we obtained on the Internet includes information of number of people it can accommodate, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, etc. We first analyze the data by doing data preprocessing, where we categorize the data and deal with missing values. Then we conduct statistical analysis on the data and draw corresponding plots and curves. After that, we split our original dataset into train set(80%) and test set(20%). Finally we use machine learning algorithms including LightGBM, CatBoost, RandomForest and XGBoost to fit the model and predict the test datasetâ€™s house price and compare the mean absolute error and mean squared error of these models. 


## Installation Instructions
