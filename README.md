## Predicting the Airbnb House Price

Our project is making a reasonable and sensible prediction for Airbnb houses price. In general, there are many features of a property that may affect its price. We are interested in how these features affect the pricing on the Airbnb property. The origin dataset we obtained on the Internet include information on number of people it can accommodate, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, etc. We first analyze the data by doing data preprocessing, where we categorize the data and deal with missing values. Then we conduct statistical analysis on the data and plot corresponding plots and curves. After that, we split our original dataset into test (80%) and train (20%). Finally we use machine learning models including LightGBM, CatBoost, RandomForest and XGBoost to regress and predict the test datasetâ€™s house price and compare the MSE of these models. 


## Installation Instructions

```
!pip install catboost
```

To install the XGBoost library:
```
!pip install xgboost
```
